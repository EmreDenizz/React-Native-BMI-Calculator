BMI CALCULATOR

Building a mobile BMI calculator

- The app should take two measurements: height and weight.
- The user should be able to select measurement system (SI [kg, cm]/Imperial[lb, in])
- Body Mass Index (or BMI) is calculated as your weight (in kilograms) divided by
the square of your height (in metres) or BMI = Kg/M2.
- Your app should show the result with the information putting the result into intervals
